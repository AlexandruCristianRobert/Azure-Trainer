### Task 12: Lab 9 — Independent

**Files:** `postgres-independent.lab.js`; extend seeds; one `it`.

**Brief (requirements only):** onboard the `contoso-support` v3 corpus in **German and English** with a new metadata field `audience` (`admin` | `user`).
- (a) Retrieval for a given product + version + language + audience returns the expected chunks, with recall ≥ 0.95 and p95 ≤ 20 ms (simulated).
- (b) Metadata lookups by `audience` use an index.
- (c) 6 replicas sustain 1000 rps with 0 failures.

Seed: the Lab 7 end state plus a supplied `load-v3.sql`.

Tasks (✓): `v3-retrieval` (rows + recall + latency from scenario evidence; any index type or tuning that meets the thresholds passes), `audience-indexed` (plan uses an index for `audience` filtering, via a B-tree on a column or GIN on `metadata`; either passes), `scale-stable` (load evidence).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Test (one `it`; the Solution is one valid design). FAIL → implement → PASS → `npm run build`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Commit `feat(data): add Lab 9 PostgreSQL independent`.

## Global Constraints

- **TESTING RULE (from the learner, binding):** never run the existing test suite. Do not run `npm test`, `npx vitest run` without a file path, or any browser tests. Run only the test files this plan names, by explicit path.
- **LIGHT TESTING (binding):** write only the tests listed here. Review fixes add a regression test only for bugs in `src/lib/data/*` core logic.
- Every task ends with `npm run build` succeeding.
- No code execution, no network, no real Azure (ADR-0001/0002). Unsupported Python or SQL returns code `DATA_UNSUPPORTED` with a message starting `Not supported by the simulator:`.
- Journey `data-knowledge-assistant`; Labs `engineVersion: 2`, `contentVersion: 1`, `skillAreaId: 'data'`, `service: 'postgresql'`, `journeyOrder` 5–9; capability `dataPostgres: true` (plus `acrBuild`, `kubernetes`).
- Server `pg-assistant` in `rg-assistant`, database `knowledge`, admin user `assistant_admin`, fictional training-only password `Training-Only-Pa55!`. FQDN `pg-assistant.postgres.database.azure.com`. Direct port 5432; built-in PgBouncer port 6432.
- Authored vectors are **8 dimensions** (`vector(8)`); the `embeddings-v2` fixture returns 12.
- Declared logical sizes: `documents` 20,000 rows, `chunks` 250,000 rows. Small visible samples hold the real values.
- All numbers are labelled `Simulated estimate — not an Azure guarantee.`
- `psql` is one-shot per Cloud Shell line (the shell has no session mode): `psql "host=<fqdn> port=5432 dbname=knowledge user=assistant_admin" -c "<SQL>"` or `... -f <project file>`. Connection flags `-h`, `-p`, `-d`, `-U` are also accepted.
- `kubectl set image` is not implemented; deploy = edit image in `k8s/deployment.yaml` → `kubectl apply`.
- **Design rules from Labs 1–4 (binding):**
  - **Guided order:** in Guided Labs, `stages` and `tasks` are in one order that can be completed top to bottom.
  - **Narrow dependencies:** every verification Task lists only the dependency fields it depends on.
  - **Standalone Solutions:** every Task Solution is complete and standalone; replaying all Solutions in order completes the Lab.
  - **Grade the learner's work:** seeds deploy starter or faulty edit zones, never solved ones, and code-graded Tasks require a learner-built image.
  - **Checks read app results:** checks read the rows, latency and plans the app or `psql` produced, never post-filtering inside the check.
  - **No import cycles:** helper modules import no Lab module, and a seed file imports at most one sibling Lab module.
- Don't change Labs 1–4 behavior or the AKS / Container Apps journeys. New branches are gated on `dataPostgres` / `manifest.dataApp`.
- Commit messages end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
